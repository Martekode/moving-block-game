# first things first
i wanted to do this project sinds i got the idea of making an object move by moving the cursor. i wanted to try this myself...
i didn't know what i was getting myself into and oh boy this is a difficult one.



## a journey's sapling
i started with the mouse coordinates and figure out how to attach them to an object with a translate to make it stick to the mouse.
this was really fun and by far the easiest of this assignement. after this i encountered the devil. he started laughing, i didn't know why but i continued on the road sinds he was not blocking my path.



## the start of the hill
i created a field called the playZone. it would serve as a perfect place to conduct the project. by applying a box shadow inset i created a border to later apply collision on.
the collision serverd as a small challenge and after my training arc with the town's grandwizard "Tim the G" (G stands for great i think) i slayed the collision boss. Suddenly a chill went down my spine and i could hear the devil's laugh. luckily it faded rather quickly and i continued on my journey. i added a counter for my hp (only console for now). while advancing on the road i noticed that it went darker with red hue all around me. i got scared of the obstacles i imagined comming for me. now the devil made more sence.

## the climb
i saw the problem... i needed enemies to spawn and chace me but oh boy was this an almost impossible task for me. even with a MASSSSSSSSIVE training arc again with Tim The G. the training arc was needed because i senced i did it the wrong way when i was trying and i could sence complications going further on the road. I managed to let enemies spawn with a limit of 5 but even though i gave it a limit... they didn't disappear. Now they do.... kind off... well... they do and they don't. it's... complicated, see... the devil is laughing in my face again and out of frustration i started writing this story. i feel another training arc comming because the devil here won't stop laughing...

## fin out in the next episode of Dragon Ball Mediocre
