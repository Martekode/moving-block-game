# first things first
i wanted to do this project sinds i got the idea of making an object move by moving the cursor. i wanted to try this myself...
i didn't know what i was getting myself into and oh boy this is a difficult one.



## a journey's sapling
i started with the mouse coordinates and figure out how to attach them to an object with a translate to make it stick to the mouse.
this was really fun and by far the easiest of this assignement. after this i encountered the devil. he started laughing, i didn't know why but i continued on the road sinds he was not blocking my path.



## the start of the hill
i created a field called the playZone. it would serve as a perfect place to conduct the project. by applying a box shadow inset i created a border to later apply collision on.
the collision serverd as a small challenge and after my training arc with the town's grandwizard "Tim the G" (G stands for great i think) i slayed the collision boss. Suddenly a chill went down my spine and i could hear the devil's laugh. luckily it faded rather quickly and i continued on my journey. i added a counter for my hp (only console for now). while advancing on the road i noticed that it went darker with red hue all around me. i got scared of the obstacles i imagined comming for me. now the devil made more sence.

## the climb
i saw the problem... i needed enemies to spawn and chace me but oh boy was this an almost impossible task for me. even with a MASSSSSSSSIVE training arc again with Tim The G. the training arc was needed because i senced i did it the wrong way when i was trying and i could sence complications going further on the road. I managed to let enemies spawn with a limit of 5 but even though i gave it a limit... they didn't disappear. Now they do.... kind off... well... they do and they don't. it's... complicated, see... the devil is laughing in my face again and out of frustration i started writing this story. i feel another training arc comming because the devil here won't stop laughing...

## Setting camp (from third person now)
the hero went mad from the laughing, but when all seemed lost he remembered the training with the grand wizard and got an idea. he just had to check if either the x value or the y value from the enemy was equal to his co√∂rdinates. But it wouldn't work because...Who is the enemy? Well, after some thinking about his training he remembered that foreach thingamajig. So he got cracking. And it worked.... "Huh!" he said simultaniously gasping. "It worked!... Still bugs though.." hitting his own forhead until it was red. But the good thing was that the devil was silent. The hero remembered his immunity check and applied it. Know he would't instantly die upon hitting the enemy.
